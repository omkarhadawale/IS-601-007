<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>Faced the same two issues which was discussed in class&nbsp;</div><div>1) The pytest not<br>found in the Git Pipeline from which got learn that we should be<br>careful while while generating requirement file as some packages may be installed globally<br>which are not in virtual environment will not appear in requirements file.</div><div>2)0 collections<br>found error of pytest in git pipeline got to learn that if their<br>is no test cases in the project the pytest will fail the entire<br>pipeline so either need to add dummy test or need to alter this<br>behavior.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> What can you tell me about docker? Describe the various steps needed to get an app ran inside a docker container in your own words</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Docker is containerized platform for deploying applications in isolated environment. Their are many<br>advantages of docker like it is very easy to deploy and it provides<br>isolated environment to test behavior of our application when we don&#39;t need any<br>interference. It is very light weight which can run on local machines as<br>well as production servers the same. It provides high scalability.<div>Steps deploy on docker:</div><div>1)To<br>deploy python application create custom python or specify existing base python images.</div><div>2)Install all<br>required packages from the requirement file.</div><div>3)Deploy the application using commands specifying port, server<br>on which to run, no of threads etc.</div><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> What is Heroku? Why do you feel it was chosen for this class?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>Heroku is paas cloud service. As in paas cloud model we don't need<br>to worry about underlying detials like networking,OS,Virtualization etc it is took care by<br>the service provider and we can only focus on developing web application.Thus I<br>think heroku is used.</div><div><br></div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> What is flask? List a few things you learned about it</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>Flask is the web application frame work used to create web applications. Learned<br>about factories and blueprints in flask. Accessing request data, rendering template etc.</div><div><br></div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> What is the difference between a Dockerfile and a Github Action .yml file?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Github .yml file is used to build CICD pipeline what jobs to run,<br>tests to run and the entire flow of the Action on the github,<br>which also includes deployment details of the application which intern deploys the application.<br>The docker file is accessed by the yml file to get the docker<br>deployment details like base image, port mapping, deployment commands etc. The docker file<br>is responsible for deploying the application on docker container and yml file is<br>for constructing the pipeline to run various jobs required to run and test<br>the application before it is deployed. And finally the yml file deploys the<br>application using deployment details from docker file.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
